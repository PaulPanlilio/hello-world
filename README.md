# hello-world
my first repository

Hi! I'm a chess game player. And I love to win. That's why I'm always hungry to learn, grow and succeed not only in playing chess game but in the game of life!

I'm fund of reading, travelling and watching movies especially those true to life stories like social network.

I would like to be a CEO and/or CTO of my own company or other's company.
